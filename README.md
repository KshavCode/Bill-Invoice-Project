# Bill Invoice Register App
Python, GUI based application created in order to create bills easier. We know that most of the wholesale shopkeepers are unable to keep up with their bills and hence this is an app which is created in order to solve such problem. Taken example of a general store, this app takes all the item list from a file along with their prices and save them which can be accessed in the future.

## Required Packages üíª
Tkinter, OS, Datetime & JSON

## Features ‚ú®
1. You just need to add items that you sell along with their prices inside the json file in the same format as in the example.
2. Then the app will run successfully!
3. While using the app, you can add quantity of a particular item otherwise, by default it's 1.
4. The invoice number is increamented automatically as soon as you fill all the required details and save it.
5. The app will automatically create a txt file (invoice number as name) in a folder of the current date along with month and year too. The app automatically scans the current date and time, so you needn't worry about doing anything.

## Future Plans ü™ê
No further plans for this project as it's built upto the requirement.
